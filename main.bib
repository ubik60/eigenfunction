  abstract = {We weaken the assumption of summable variations in a paper by Verbitskiy \textbackslash cite\{verb\} to a weaker condition, Berbee's condition, in order for a 1-block factor (a single site renormalisation) of the full shift space on finitely many symbols to have a \$g\$-measure with a continuous \$g\$-function. But we also prove by means of a counterexample, that this condition is (within constants) optimal. The counterexample is based on the second of our main results, where we prove that there is an inverse critical temperature in a one-sided long-range Ising model which is at most 8 times the critical inverse temperature for the (two-sided) Ising model with long-range interactions.},
